# Quant-Wing-2020
My submission of the Quant Wing 2020 assignment, ID number-2019AAPS0214G.

Questions attempted - all.
Note - 
1.Q2 - done in 2 methods-
  1. USing LSTM model to predict stock prices.
  2. Using Bollinger Bands strategy following an online tutorial. 
2.Q3 - couldn't code Markowitz Efficiency Frontier properly. I made my own strategy - made a correlation matrix of the top 20 stocks and wrote a code to find top 5 uncorrelated stocks.
3. Some package errors are popping up when viewed here since it's in Jupyter notebook whereas I did everything on Google Colab so did not have to install those packages.
